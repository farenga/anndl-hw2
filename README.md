# ANNDL-competition

This repository contains the material related to the 2nd Competition of the Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning Course, Politecnico di Milano.

The architectures we have tested are the following:

1. Base-RNN
2. 1-layer LSTM
3. multi-layer LSTM
4. LSTM seq2seq
4. LSTM seq2seq + Attention

The notebooks referred to their comparison can be found in the
[`architectures-comparison`](architectures-comparison)  folder.

We have performed multiple tests under different hyperparameters combinations, they can be found in the [`hyperparameters-tuning`](hyperparameters-tuning)  folder.

After selecting the models that performed better we have trained those architectures on the complete dataset, the notebooks are stored in the  [`final-training`](final-training) folder.
